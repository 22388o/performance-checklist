## The goal

The goal of this repo is to gather common techniques used when developing a web application to improve its performance.

## The rules

When adding a practice to this checklist, the following rules should be applied:

- Of course the practice should be only about performance.
- Redundancy should be avoided, so prefer modifying an existing practice over duplicating if you want to add information.
- The practices should be commonly accepted as good practices; obscure hacks should be avoided.
- The practices should be concise but easy to understand; if possible add a link to some documentation on it.
- If there is no mainstream alternative, a link to a tool can be added to a practice if it can help realizing it.
